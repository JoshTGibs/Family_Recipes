# Family_Recipes
The beginnings of a project my family can use to share recipes they love and be inspired by other's creations.

I've got the main functionability down and just need to make it look pretty before deploying it for actual use. I will be adding a "Home Page" that will give everyone a little discription of the function and navigation of the page as well.
Right now I've got it functioning as I'd like and this is what it looks like as of now:
